    You are invited to participate in a research study aimed at developing tools for detecting and labelling audio clips. Your participation will involve playing a game where you rate audio segments and assess their persuasiveness.

    RISKS AND BENEFITS:
    - Risks: There are no significant risks associated with participating in this study.
    - Benefits: Your participation will contribute to scientific knowledge and the development of tools to detect and mitigate the impact of manipulated audio in various contexts.

    PROCEDURE:
    You will participate in a game where you listen to various audio clips and provide ratings on their persuasiveness and authenticity. The game is designed to be engaging and will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

    CONFIDENTIALITY:
    Your responses will be kept confidential and anonymised. All data will be securely stored, and individual responses will not be identifiable in any reports or publications resulting from this study.

    VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION:
    Participation is voluntary. You have the right to refuse or withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.

    DATA PROTECTION:
    All collected data will be anonymised and stored securely in compliance with GDPR regulations. Personal identifiers will be removed, and only aggregated data will be used for analysis and reporting.

    CONTACT INFORMATION:
    If you have any questions or concerns about this study, please contact **orestis.p@tum.de**.
